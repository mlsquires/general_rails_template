# DON'T CHECK THIS IN
#
# This .bundle/config has BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS set to false,
# which installs/uses gems from their standard version (e.g.,
# system ruby, rbenv version, etc).
#
# If you are using Docker or if you don't mind sharing gems
# on a system, this is what you want. If you want to isolate
# your application from others on your system, change this
# to true
